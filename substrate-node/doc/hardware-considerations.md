# Hardware Considerations for Full Nodes

## Storage

Your full node will need enough storage space for every SIIP certificate online
and for the full history of the blockchain. We anticipate that you should have
approximately a terabyte of storage available for your full node. For best performance,
we recommend solid state memory, although it is not necessarily required.
